0. Copy grab_images_new.sh, get_scanner_coords_MNI.m, get_scanner_coords_longitudinal.m to your MRS directory

1. Collect T1w image with 3D reconstruction on the scanner

2. Pull T1w from scanner and create NIFTI
	Open LXTerminal and enter:

	cd <your_MRS_folder>
	./grab_images_new.sh <exam number> <series number>

	Enter the exam number and series number of the subject's T1w scan. The script will pull the DICOMs of the T1w and convert to NIFTI, save as anat.nii.gz.

3. Matlab processing
	Open Matlab (enter in terminal matlab) and enter:

	cd <your_MRS_folder>

        Option 1 -- Prescribe MRS voxel using coordinates in the template space, run:
	
                get_scanner_coords_MNI({'label'}, [x,y,z])

	        {'label'} is a cell containing the label of the voxel, [x,y,z] is an array containing the coordinates of the voxel in the template space, in [R/L, A/P, S/I] format. The default template is MNI512_T1_2mm_brain. 

        Option 2 -- Longitudinal study (prescribing MRS voxel in the 2nd session), run:

	        get_scanner_coords_longitudinal('<S1_T1w>', [x,y,z])

	        [x,y,z] is the voxel center coordinates in the 1st session. It should be in [R/L, A/P, S/I] format, e.g. if the coordinates in the 1st session were [S29, L25, A30], then [x,y,z] = [-25, 30, 29].


4. Input coordinate on the scanner for MRS acquisition
